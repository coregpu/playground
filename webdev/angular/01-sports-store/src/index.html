  <!-- Include jQuery, Popper.js and Bootstrap JS -->
  <!-- TODO: Bootstrap JS needs to be run each time a new element is added to the DOM -->
  <!-- in order to register the dynamic behavior (such as those required by Bootstrap -->
  <!-- alerts). However, Angular will execute the Boostrap JS (included in the scripts -->
  <!-- field in angular.json) only once after the page is rendered for the first time. -->
  <!-- This partial fix works around this issue by loading the Bootstrap JS directly -->
  <!-- in index.html, which means that it will be run each time a new module is loaded -->
  <!-- (for example when admin module is loaded). This is not a complete fix however, -->
  <!-- because in case a DOM element requiring Bootstrap JS plugin to run is added to -->
  <!-- DOM, it won't behave properly because Bootstrap has not been run. This is why -->
  <!-- ng-bootstrap needs to be used instead, which takes care of attaching this dynamic -->
  <!-- behavior to the DOM elements. -->
