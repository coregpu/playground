/**
 * The following component illustrates the search scope of the @ContentChildren
 * decorator. This decorator searches only the content of the element where the
 * corresponding directive (that uses @ContentChildren to query to content) is
 * applied. Let's assume that the directive using the @ContentChildren has the
 * selector set to 'directiveUsingContentChildrenDecorator' while the directive
 * to be queried has the selector set to 'directiveToBeQueried'.
 *
 * The component's host element is written as follows:
 *
 * <component-host-elem directiveUsingContentChildrenDecorator>
 *   <p directiveToBeQueried>Paragraph 1</p>
 * </component-host-elem>
 *
 * and the component's template is written as follows:
 *
 * <ng-content></ng-content>
 * <div>
 *   <p directiveToBeQueried>Paragraph 2</p>
 * </div>
 *
 * Because the @ContentChildren decorator queries only the contents of the element
 * to which the directive is applied (in this case the directiveUsingContentChildrenDecorator
 * directive), the content query will match only the `Paragraph 1` but not the `Paragraph 2`
 * within the component's template. In other words, @ContentChildren as well as @ContentChild
 * decorators query directives in the content projected using the ng-content element.
 *
 * @note According to the description above, a content child of an element A is any element that
 * is found in the contents of element A. This excludes elements found in the template of a
 * component. Elements in the template are view children and are queried using the @ViewChild
 * and @ViewChildren directives that ignoring the content of the component's host element (i.e.
 * content projected with ng-content. For example of this check
 * components-in-detail/product-table.component.ts.
