     * @todo This is a hack to get scripts from loc8r-common module compiled
     * into the loc8r-ng Angular app. Make loc8r-common an Angular library
     * instead, which is then imported into the loc8r-ng app. Among other
     * things, this will reduce the output binary size as only loc8r-common
     * scripts actually used by loc8r-ng will be included in the output
     * binary (as opposed to the current solution, where entirently of
     * loc8r-common gets included).
